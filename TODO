TODO

* retroactive client_id updates for old sessions that were incorrectly identified
  * the client id can be more accurately matched after postback to updatesession.php
  * compare which client matches more by checking probability
* update SELECT statements to use filtered views where possible (e.g. for flags like deleted or active)
* modularize the javascript a little so that SherlockSession has a getJsBlock() method
* add pretty output of all tracked datapoints for user's pleasure

BRAINSTORM

* add "method" parameter to printdefs (http, js, ?) (for what?)
* do something with unclaimed tokens and cookies
* how to use non-matches to increase accuracy?
* blacklist abusive clients
* deal with clients that block cookies
  * clean up unclaimed cookies in fp_record
  * flag clients that repeatedly don't claim cookies?
* use hotness formula based on session_record timestamps (newer = more likely)
* integrate evercookie
* integrate cache.php
* create profiles / modes to use (e.g. silent, cookie-based, aggressive, etc.)
  * sets of datapoints to use / ignore
  * programmatically switch profiles as necessary
  * modes: listen only, average, full/aggressive
* user-controlled linking of sessions and clients by means of self-identifcation (login)
* how to detect mismatched cookies and make things right in the world
* statistics / reporting
  * datapoint variance
  * most useful/useless datapoints

RESEARCH / DOCUMENT

* what datapoints are protected/cleared by:
  * clear private data feature in each browser
  * vpn / proxies
  * tor
* framework for generating urls with various behaviors
  * etag tracking
  * cache timestamp tracking
* defenses against intentional data poisoning
* clustering of datapoints for multiple clients / locations / devices
* fuzzier matching

DATAPOINTS PLANNED

* if-mod-since header (token)
* etag / if-none-match header (token)
* client timezone (js)
* client time offset from server (js)
* capabilities / plugins (js)

DATAPOINTS UNDER CONSIDERATION

* page visits
  * resource + referring resource
  * accessed resource
  * order of visits and links clicked
* referring domain / referring url
* request round-trip time (measured by js, cluster/bucket)
* cached / uncached or requested / unrequested resources
* javascript benchmarks
* network metrics
* requested resource files cached html (?)
  * refer to resource that returns no-cache headers (?)
  * i copied this straight from my notes. hopefully i'll remember what i meant at a later time
* window.name (thanks samy)
* geolocation, whether through own database or third-party service
* visited links (?)
* javascript disabled (via <noscript><img>)
* video/audio volume attribute (desktop only)
* third-party identifier
